            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <h2>Why does nothing happen when I open Lime3DS?</h2>
            <p>There 3 executables that come with Lime3DS named 'lime3ds-cli', 'lime3ds-room', and 'lime3ds-gui'.</p>
            <p>Please ensure you are opening the program named 'lime3ds-gui'.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2>Why does Lime3DS crash repeatedly?</h2>
            <p>Please ensure that your device reaches the minimum specifications required to use Lime3DS.</p>
            <p>You can find these in <a href="https://github.com/Lime3DS/Lime3DS/blob/master/README.md#minimum-requirements">our GitHub readme</a>.</p>

            <h2>How does Lime3DS compare to Citra Enhanced?</h2>
            <p>While Lime3DS and Citra Enhanced were both created from Citra's demise, we have expressedly different goals.</p>
            <p>Lime3DS aims to continue Citra's development as it always was and maintain the status quo with a focus on stability, careful consideration and proper procedure with all changes made to the emulator.</p>
            <p>Citra Enhanced on the other hand focuses on advanced "hacks" which attempt to squeeze as much performance out of games as possible at the cost of stability and code sanity.</p>
            <p>Both forks have their own independent purpose for existing, and are not competing projects.</p>
