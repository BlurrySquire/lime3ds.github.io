# Lime3DS Website
### Repo structure
`staging`: Main branch used for development. Content in this branch will eventually make its way into the live website when it is ready.

`live`: Contains the live version of the website. No commits should ever be made to this branch directly, and instead the staging branch is periodically merged into it as appropriate.
